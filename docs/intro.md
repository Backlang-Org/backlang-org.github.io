# Introduction

Have you ever wondered why there is no good other language on the .Net platform like C#? Backlang is a try to give .Net a new kind of language. 
Backlang's main focus is on reducing code duplicates and code by context. The macro systems allows us to run functionality before compilation or generating source code on the fly.

Backlang can be used functional or OOP.
