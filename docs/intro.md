# Introduction

Have you ever wondered why there is no good other language on the .Net platform like C#? Backlang is a try to give .Net a new kind of language. 
Backlang's main focus is on reducing code duplicates and code by context. The macro systems allows us to run functionality before compilation or generating source code on the fly.

Backlang can be used functional or OOP. 

## Why a new language?

C# is a really good language but has a lack of code reduction. F# has really nice features but is less intuitive. So I have decided to build a new language to fill the gap between C#, F# and added a macro system for code reduction and the ability to make with macros custom language constructs to hide complex problems in a Domain Specific Language. There is also the possibility of writing inline assembly to use runtime features that are not yet available on the language itself.
