# Variables

to define a new variable, just type

```back
let age = 0;
```

if you want to specify the type of a variable, you can easily do that with a `:`

```back
let name: string = "Bob";
```

A list of all backsic primitive datatypes can you find [here](/#/learn/primitive-datatypes).

Variables by default are immutable, so you can't change their value. To make them mutable, define it with `mut`

```back
let mut accelerator = 3.5;
```
