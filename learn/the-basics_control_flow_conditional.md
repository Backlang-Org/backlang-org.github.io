# Conditional Control Flow

## If Statements

If-statements behave like how you would expect them to behave

First, you write `if`, then the condition and at last one single statement or a block
Do it like so:

```back
if age >= 18 {
    // the person is older than 18 years
}
```

When the condition is false, you can also run code with the `else` keyword

```back
if age >= 18 {
    // the person is older than 18 years
} else {
    // person is younger than 18 years
}
```
